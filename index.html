                <p class="app-description">
                    I remember doing a charity we were collecting for sick kids hospital I was 11 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    We had to stand outside and invite people in as they walked into a Walmart and tell them to donate to the charity 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    Nobody was interested everyone just wanted to get to the store and get their things 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    I then being upset with the rejection thought we could turn the tables 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    I started singing and playing drums on the bollards singing a simple jingle "donate to the sick kids hospital, and the Aurora jays. Every penny counts enjoy your day" 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    We began getting an absurd amount of donations from almost a 99% rejection rate we started converting over 50% of the people walking into the Walmart 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    We also were getting so many donations that it wasn't fast enough to take the people in have them fill out a card and donate at the desk inside 
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    Rather I asked someone at the store for a container to collect the money directly
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    This then brought our rate up even more going from almost half the people to nearly every single shopper minus a few who still greeted us with smiles pulling out some amount of cash or coins and adding it to the tin  
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    We raised more than that charity had ever raided in a day collecting at a single store front and we did it in just a few hours with a simple song and positive energy.

                <p class="app-description">
                    3D printed fingerboard ramps made for tech deck and fingerboard toys. Although I had experience creating movie scenes in Blender, designing a functional product was a different challenge entirely. It took many iterations learning how to work with a 3D printer, as well as learning how to optimize designs for successful prints. The process involved constant testing: What worked? What didn't? If the product broke during use, why did it break? How could I add supports? How could I design it in a more efficient and stable way?
                </p>
                <p class="app-description">
                    While the total adjustable market for this product wasn't huge, the high number of iterations taught me valuable lessons about product design, structural integrity, and the practical applications of 3D printing technology.
